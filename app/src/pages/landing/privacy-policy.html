<p>
This is the Privacy Policy of the TempStars website and mobile applications (together, the “Application”), operated by Sudden Turtle Dental Consulting Inc. (together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, “TempStars”, “we”, “us”, “our” and terms of similar meaning) and our related products and services. It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of he Application, and how we use and disclose this information.
</p>
<p>
By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration or by visiting and/or using the Application, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use, www.tempstars.ca/terms
</p>
<p>
In this Privacy Policy, we use the term “User” to describe different types of users of the Application, including registered users and casual browsers of the Application.
</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Application, to provide to you the services offered by the Application; resolve service and billing disputes; troubleshoot problems; bill any amounts due from you; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, events and updates; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your interests, such as product news; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use; provide you with system or administrative messages, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
<p>
We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Application usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Application's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Application and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Application.
</p>
<p>
On occasion we use email address or other contact information to contact our Users with our newsletter or other similar communication, or to ask them for their input on our services.  In general, any email or other electronic message we send you will contain a link or other instructions to permit you to unsubscribe from such email or messages, except that certain emails or messages are essential to the operation of the Application and you must cancel your account to opt out of receiving them.
</p>
<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
<p>
Once you become a registered User, we require you to provide various contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the relevant forms in the Application (which vary, depending on what kind of User you are), and you are no longer anonymous to us. Where possible, on these forms we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.  We collect information when you register to join us by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party sites ("TPS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter). For example, our Application allows you to create an account and login for the Application using your Facebook account credentials. If you are not currently registered as a user of our Application and you click on “Sign Up with Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join us.  If you decide to create your user account by logging into a TPS account via the Application, you are using the personal information you have already provided to the TPS (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the TPS) to create your user account with us. The information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the TPS, so please consult the TPS’s privacy and data practices. The personal information we may collect in this way may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, TPS sign-in or username, profile photo, and any biography you have provided to them.
</p>
<p>
In addition, as you use the Application, you can from time to time enter or send to us personal information. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to become a User or by not using the particular feature of the Application for which the information is being collected.
</p>
<p>
We use cookies and log data in various ways, as described below. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we use “persistent” cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Application. Second, we use “session ID” cookies to enable certain features of the Application, to better understand how you interact with the Application and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Application and close your browser. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Application.
</p>
<p>
When you use our Application, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends (“log data”). This log data may include information such as the browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Application, pages of our Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Application and the Application’s technical administration, to increase the Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Application to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Application again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Application meet the criteria required to process their requests.
</p>
<p>
We also use Google, as a third party vendor, to serve our ads on other websites. Google uses what it calls a “DART cookie” to enable it to serve ads to users based on their visits to participating websites. As a result of our use of Google as a vendor and the use of DART cookies, the ads that you will be served on the internet may in some cases be based on your visit to our Application.
</p>
<p>
We may also use other third-party services to assist us in using and analyzing these tools and the data they provide, and in monitoring your use of the Application.
</p>
<p>
Following your registration on the Application, you can review and change your information in your account area. If you disclose personal information in any posting in our forum or blog and wish to have it removed, please contact us at the support contact information listed below, and posted on the Application.
</p>
<h3>Our Disclosure of Your Information</h3>

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services:

<h4>Anonymized Aggregated Data.</h4>
We aggregate and anonymize Application use information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to Users and others. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.

<h4>Public Display or Display to other Users.</h4>
If you post on our forum or blog your username and other information you include is displayed in your postings or comments, and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities in the public areas of the forum will be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published profile content.  When you register through the Application and submit personal information to create a User profile or a collection, other users will see your name. If you choose to provide additional personal information in your profile, other users will see that additional personal information, including, but not limited to, your photo, location, website and biography. Providing additional personal information is voluntary. We recommend that you avoid disclosing any information you consider sensitive and confidential.  In certain cases the Application allows Users to provide ratings and reviews of other Users, and such information will be published on the areas of the Application visible to registered Users. When completing and Evaluation Survey, comments designated as Public may be visible to all members of the public, regardless of whether they are registered users or not.  Regarding comments designated as Private, we make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of these comments although we make not warrant of guarantee that these comments might not be made inadvertently public.

<h4>Third Party Services.</h4>
We may share the information in your user account (including your personal information) with the TPSs that you have linked to your account. These TPSs have access to your personal information only for this purpose (unless the TPS has received your personal information independently of the Application) and not for other purposes. You may update certain TPS preferences, including the option to share or post your activity through your respective TPS accounts, under your account settings.

<h4>Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers.</h4>
We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Application, and may disclose personal information to them in the course of our use of their services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the Application. This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies, and in some cases those servers may be located in, or data enroute to or from those servers may transit, other jurisdictions, including the United States. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Please see the bottom of this policy for further information about how to direct any questions you might have about service providers outside of Canada.

<h4>Legal Requests and Business Transitions; Emergencies.</h4>
We may disclose any of your personal information in our possession if we believe it necessary or appropriate to do so (a) to respond to any governmental authority as part of an investigation to determine our compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation (including privacy laws, rules, and regulations), (b) in response to a court order, subpoena, discovery request or other lawful request, or judicial or administrative proceeding, (c) as otherwise required under any applicable law, rule, or regulation, (d) to protect or defend our rights or property or those of other users, or (e) if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets (you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Application of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information).

<h3>Controlling Your Information</h3>
<h4>Cookies.</h4>
 If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Application, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
<h4>Note:</h4>
The service does not currently employ TPS login/sign-up, but if that becomes an option you may decide at any time that you no longer wish to have your TPS account linked to your account with us, you will be able to de-link the TPS account in your user account settings on the Application.

<h3>Your Use of Other Persons’ Information</h3>
By entering into our Terms of Use, you agree that, with respect to the personal information of other persons that you collect, use and disclose on the Application, you have all necessary consents and rights to collect, use and disclose that information as described in this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you agree that the indemnity you give to us in the Terms of Use applies to any non-compliance by you with the foregoing.

<h3>Security</h3>
We strive to protect your personal information although we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Application and in our Terms of Use.

<h3>Other Information Collectors</h3>
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Application, different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

<h3>Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information</h3>
To review, delete and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, you may login into your account to make the changes, or you may contact us at help@tempstars.ca

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

<h3>Additional Policy Information</h3>
If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will leave the Application and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third-party product or service in conjunction with ours, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as we do. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to the Application, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at help@tempstars.ca.
